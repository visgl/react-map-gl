## react-map-gl example with React Component

The configuration showcased here is a bit less straightforward than its browserify
equivalent due to some incompatibilities with mapbox-gl, but has been kept at a
strict minimum.

You should keep in mind that it is a development configuration, and probably
should be tweaked a bit for production optimization, there is plenty ressources
on the subject and are not in the scope of this example.
