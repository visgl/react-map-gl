# Example: Controls

Demonstrates how various control components can be used with react-map-gl.

## Usage

To run this example, you need a [Mapbox token](http://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens). You can either set it as `MAPBOX_TOKEN` in `src/app.js`, or set a `MapboxAccessToken` environment variable in the command line.

Alternative to acquiring a Mapbox token, you can install `maplibre-gl` and change all `import from 'react-map-gl'` to `import from 'react-map-gl/maplibre'`. You also need to supply a third-party or self-hosted `mapStyle` URL.

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
