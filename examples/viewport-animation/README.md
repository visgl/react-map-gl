# Example: Viewport Animation

This example showcases how to transition smoothly between one viewport to another.

## Usage

To run this example, you need a [Mapbox token](http://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens). You can either set it as `MAPBOX_TOKEN` in `src/app.js`, or set a `MapboxAccessToken` environment variable in the command line.

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
