# default (InteractiveMap)

![Since v3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/since-v3.0-green)

This component renders `MapboxGL` and provides full interactivity support.
It uses `StaticMap` underneath to render the final map component.
This is the `default` exported component from `react-map-gl`.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import ReactMapGL from 'react-map-gl';

function App() {
  const [viewport, setViewport] = React.useState({
    longitude: -122.45,
    latitude: 37.78,
    zoom: 14
  });
  return (
    <ReactMapGL {...viewport} width="100vw" height="100vh" onViewportChange={setViewport} />
  );
}
```

- default: `true`

Enable scroll to zoom. If an object is provided, may contain the following options to customize the scroll zoom behavior:

- `speed` (Number) - Multiplier for the wheel delta. Default `0.01`.
- `smooth` (Boolean) - Smoothly transition to the new zoom. If enabled, will provide a slightly lagged but smoother experience. Default `false`.

##### `dragPan` (Boolean|Object)

- default: `true`

Enable drag to pan. If an object is provided, may contain the following options to customize its behavior:

- `inertia` (Number) - Enable momentum/inertia when the gesture ends. The value specifies after how long the panning comes to a stop, in milliseconds. Default `300`.

##### `dragRotate` (Boolean)

- default: `true`

Enable drag to rotate. If an object is provided, may contain the following options to customize its behavior:

- `inertia` (Number) - Enable momentum/inertia when the gesture ends. The value specifies after how long the rotation comes to a stop, in milliseconds. Default `300`.

##### `doubleClickZoom` (Boolean)

- default: `true`

Enable double click to zoom.

##### `touchZoom` (Boolean|Object)

- default: `true`

Enable multitouch zoom. If an object is provided, may contain the following options to customize its behavior:

- `inertia` (Number) - Enable momentum/inertia when the gesture ends. The value specifies after how long the zooming comes to a stop, in milliseconds. Default `300`.

##### `touchRotate` (Boolean|Object)

- default: `false`

Enable multitouch rotate, including two-finger rotation to change bearing and three-finger swipe to change pitch. If an object is provided, may contain the following options to customize its behavior:

- `inertia` (Number) - Enable momentum/inertia when the gesture ends. The value specifies after how long the rotation comes to a stop, in milliseconds. Default `300`.

##### `keyboard` (Boolean|Object)

- `zoomSpeed` (Number) - speed of zoom using +/- keys. Default `2`.
- `moveSpeed` (Number) - speed of movement using arrow keys, in pixels.
- `rotateSpeedX` (Number) - speed of rotation using shift + left/right arrow keys, in degrees. Default `15`.
- `rotateSpeedY` (Number) - speed of rotation using shift + up/down arrow keys, in degrees. Default `10`.


##### `touchAction` (String)

- default: `'none'`

Allow browser default touch actions. Default `none`. See [hammer.js doc](http://hammerjs.github.io/touch-action/).

By default, the map captures all touch interactions. This prop is useful for mobile applications to unblock default scrolling behavior. For example, use the combination `dragPan: false` and `touchAction: 'pan-y'` to allow vertical page scroll when dragging over the map.

##### `eventRecognizerOptions` (Object)

- default: `{}`

Set options for gesture recognition. My contain the following fields:

- `pan` - an object that is [Hammer.Pan](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pan/) options. This gesture is used for drag events.
- `pinch` - an object that is [Hammer.Pinch](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pinch/) options This gesture is used for two-finger touch events.
- `tripan` - an object that is [Hammer.Pan](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pan/) options.  This gesture is used for three-finger touch events.
- `tap` - an object that is [Hammer.Tap](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-tap/) options. This gesture is used for the `onClick` callback.
- `anytap` - an object that is [Hammer.Tap](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-tap/) options. This gesture is used for the `onNativeClick` callback.
- `doubletap` - an object that is [Hammer.Tap](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-tap/) options. This gesture is used for double click events.

For example, the following setting makes panning less sensitive and clicking easier on mobile:

```jsx
const eventRecognizerOptions = isMobile ? {
  pan: {threshold: 10},
  tap: {threshold: 5}
} : {};

<MapGL
  eventRecognizerOptions={eventRecognizerOptions}
/>
```

Note that the value of this prop is used once when the component mounts. Subsequent changes will be ignored.

##### `clickRadius` (Number)

- default: `0`

Radius to detect features around a clicked point.

##### `controller` (Object)

A map controller instance to replace the default map controller.

This object must implement the following interface:
- `events` - An array of subscribed events
- `handleEvent(event, context)` - A method that handles interactive events

##### `interactiveLayerIds` (Array)

- default: `null`

A list of layer ids that are interactive. If specified:
- Pointer event callbacks will only query the features under the pointer of these layers.
- The `getCursor` callback will receive `isHovering: true` when hover over features of these layers.

If not specified:
- Pointer event callbacks will query the features under the pointer of all layers.
- The `getCursor` callback will always receive `isHovering: false`.


### Transitions

##### `transitionDuration` (Number)

- default: `0`

Duration of transition in milliseconds. If specified, the map's viewport will smoothly move from the previous props to the current one.

##### `transitionInterpolator` (Object)

- default: `new LinearInterpolator()`

An interpolator object that defines the transition behavior between two map states. `react-map-gl` offers two interpolators:
- `LinearInterpolator` - similar to Mapbox's `easeTo` behavior.
- `FlyToInterpolator` - similar to Mapbox's `flyTo` behavior.

You may import them as follows:
```jsx
import ReactMapGL, {LinearInterpolator, FlyToInterpolator} from 'react-map-gl';

<ReactMapGL transitionDuration={1000} transitionInterpolator={new FlyToInterpolator()}>
```

For details about using transition interpolators, see [transitions](/docs/advanced/viewport-transitions.md).

##### `transitionEasing` (Function)

- default: `t => t`

Easing function that maps a value from `[0, 1]` to `[0, 1]`. Check out [http://easings.net/](http://easings.net/) for common easing curves.

##### `transitionInterruption` (Number)

- default: `TRANSITION_EVENTS.BREAK`

What to do if an ongoing transition is interrupted by another transition. There are 4 options:
- `TRANSITION_EVENTS.BREAK` - Start new transition from the current view.
- `TRANSITION_EVENTS.SNAP_TO_END` - Jump to the end of the previous transition before starting the new transition.
- `TRANSITION_EVENTS.IGNORE` - Complete the previous transition and ignore the new viewport change.
- `TRANSITION_EVENTS.UPDATE` - Continue the ongoing transition but change its destination to the new viewport.

You may import the constants as follows:

```js
import {TRANSITION_EVENTS} from 'react-map-gl';
```


### Callbacks

Inherit the following props from [StaticMap](/docs/api-reference/static-map.md):

- `onLoad` (Function)
- `onResize` (Function)
- `onError` (Function)


##### `onViewportChange` (Function)

Callback that is fired when the map's viewport properties should be updated. If not supplied, the map is not interactive.

```js
onViewportChange(viewState, interactionState, oldViewState);
```

Arguments:

- `viewState` (Object) The next viewport properties, including: `width`, `height`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `zoom`, `bearing`, `pitch`, `altitude`, `maxZoom`, `minZoom`, `maxPitch`, `minPitch`, `transitionDuration`, `transitionEasing`, `transitionInterpolator`, `transitionInterruption`.
- `interactionState` (Object) The current interaction that caused this viewport change. See `onInteractionStateChange` for possible fields.
- `oldViewState` (Object) The current viewport properties.


##### `onViewStateChange` (Function)

A newer version of the `onViewportChange` callback. Both are supported and provide equivalent functionality.

```js
onViewStateChange({viewState, interactionState, oldViewState});
```


##### `onInteractionStateChange` (Function)

Callback that is fired when the user interacted with the map.

```js
onInteractionStateChange(interactionState)
```

Possible fields include:

- `interactionState.inTransition` (Boolean)
- `interactionState.isDragging` (Boolean)
- `interactionState.isPanning` (Boolean)
- `interactionState.isRotating` (Boolean)
- `interactionState.isZooming` (Boolean)

Note:
* `onInteractionStateChange` may be fired without `onViewportChange`. For example, when the pointer is released at the end of a drag-pan, `isDragging` are reset to `false`, without the viewport's `longitude` and `latitude` changing.


##### `onHover` (Function)
