# default (Map)

React component that wraps mapbox-gl's [Map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) class. This is also the default export from react-map-gl.

```tsx title="app.tsx"
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl/mapbox';
import 'mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Map
      mapboxAccessToken="<Mapbox access token>"
      initialViewState={{
        longitude: -122.4,
        latitude: 37.8,
        zoom: 14
      }}
      style={{width: 600, height: 400}}
      mapStyle="mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9"
    />
  );
}
```


## Properties

Aside from the props listed below, the `Map` component supports all parameters of the `Map` class constructor ([Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) | [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/type-aliases/MapOptions/)). Beware that this is not an exhaustive list of all props. Different base map libraries may offer different options and default values. When in doubt, refer to your base map library's documentation.

### Layout options

#### `id`: string {#id}

Map container id.

Required when [`MapProvider`](./map-provider.md)s are used. Used to reference the map with [`useMap`](./use-map.md).

Make sure to pick a name that has no conflict with other imports (there are no checks or errors in this case).

#### `style`: CSSProperties {#style}

Default: `{position: 'relative', width: '100%', height: '100%'}`

Map container CSS.

#### `cursor`: string {#cursor}

Default: `'auto'`

The current cursor [type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor).

### Styling options

#### `fog`: [Fog](./types.md#fog) {#fog}

The fog property of the style. Must conform to the [Fog Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/fog/).
If `undefined` is provided, removes the fog from the map.

#### `light`: [Light](./types.md#light) {#light}

Light properties of the style. Must conform to the [Light Style Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/#light).

#### `mapStyle`: [MapStyle](./types.md#mapstyle) | string | Immutable {#mapstyle}

Default: (empty style)

The map's Mapbox style. This must be an a JSON object conforming to the schema described in the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), or a URL to such JSON.

#### `projection`: string | [Projection](./types.md#projection) {#projection}

Default: `'mercator'`

The projection the map should be rendered in. Available projections are Albers (`'albers'`), Equal Earth (`'equalEarth'`), Equirectangular/Plate Carrée/WGS84 (`'equirectangular'`), Lambert (`'lambertConformalConic'`), Mercator (`'mercator'`), Natural Earth (`'naturalEarth'`), and Winkel Tripel (`'winkelTripel'`). Conic projections such as Albers and Lambert have configurable `center` and `parallels` properties that allow developers to define the region in which the projection has minimal distortion; see [example](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#setprojection).

#### `renderWorldCopies`: boolean {#renderworldcopies}

Default: `true`

If `true`, multiple copies of the world will be rendered, when zoomed out.

#### `styleDiffing`: boolean {#stylediffing}

Default: `true`

Enable diffing when `mapStyle` changes. If `false`, force a 'full' update, removing the current style and building the given one instead of attempting a diff-based update.

#### `terrain`: [Terrain](./types.md#terrain) {#terrain}

Terrain property of the style. Must conform to the [Terrain Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/terrain/).
If `undefined` is provided, removes terrain from the map.

### Other options

The following props, along with any options of the `Map` class ([Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) | [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/type-aliases/MapOptions/)) not listed above, can be specified to construct the underlying `Map` instance.

Note: props in this section are not reactive. They are only used once when the Map instance is constructed.

#### `mapLib`: any {#maplib}

Default:

- `import('mapbox-gl')` if imported from `react-map-gl`
- `import('maplibre-gl')` if imported from `react-map-gl/maplibre`

Specify the underlying base map library for the Map component. The value can be provided with several options:

By module import (and embedding in the final bundle):

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl/mapbox';
import mapboxgl from 'mapbox-gl';

function App() {
  return <Map mapLib={mapboxgl} />;
}
```

By dynamic import (thus enable bundle splitting):

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl/mapbox';

function App() {
  return <Map mapLib={import('mapbox-gl')} />;
}
```

Or to load a pre-bundled version of the library:

```html title="index.html"
<script src="https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.4.0/mapbox-gl.js"></script>
```

```tsx title="app.tsx"
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl/mapbox';

function App() {
  return <Map mapLib={window.mapboxgl} />;
}
```

#### `mapboxAccessToken`: string {#mapboxaccesstoken}

Token used to access the Mapbox data service. See [about map tokens](../../get-started/mapbox-tokens.md).

#### `baseApiUrl`: string {#baseapiurl}

The map's default API URL for requesting tiles, styles, sprites, and glyphs.

#### `maxParallelImageRequests`: number {#maxparallelimagerequests}

Default: `16`

The maximum number of images (raster tiles, sprites, icons) to load in parallel.

#### `reuseMaps`: boolean {#reusemaps}

Default: `false`

By default, every time a map component is unmounted, all internal resources associated with the underlying `Map` instance are released. If the map gets mounted again, a new `Map` instance is constructed.

If `reuseMaps` is set to `true`, when a map component is unmounted, the underlying `Map` instance is retained in memory. The next time a map component gets mounted, the saved instance is reused. This behavior may be desirable if an application frequently mounts/unmounts map(s), for example in a tabbed or collapsable UI, and wants to avoid Mapbox's [billable events](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/releases/tag/v2.0.0) triggered by initialization.

Note that since some map options cannot be modified after initialization, when reusing maps, only the reactive props and `initialViewState` of the new component are respected.

#### `RTLTextPlugin`: string | false {#rtltextplugin}

Default: `'https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/mapbox-gl-rtl-text/v0.2.3/mapbox-gl-rtl-text.js'`

Sets the map's [RTL text plugin](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/#mapbox-gl-rtl-text). Necessary for supporting the Arabic and Hebrew languages, which are written right-to-left.

Setting this prop is the equivalent of calling [mapboxgl.setRTLTextPlugin](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/properties/#setrtltextplugin) with `lazy: true`. Set to `false` to disable loading the RTL text plugin.

#### `workerClass`: object {#workerclass}

Default: `null`

Provides an interface for external module bundlers such as Webpack or Rollup to package mapbox-gl's WebWorker into a separate class and integrate it with the library.
Takes precedence over `workerUrl`.

#### `workerCount`: number {#workercount}

Default: `2`

The number of web workers instantiated on a page with mapbox-gl maps.

#### `workerUrl`: string {#workerurl}

Provides an interface for loading mapbox-gl's WebWorker bundle from a self-hosted URL. This is useful if your site needs to operate in a strict CSP (Content Security Policy) environment wherein you are not allowed to load JavaScript code from a Blob URL, which is default behavior.

## Methods

Imperative methods are accessible via a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs) or the [useMap](./use-map.md) hook.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {useRef, useCallback} from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl/mapbox';
import type {MapRef} from 'react-map-gl/mapbox';

function App() {
  const mapRef = useRef<MapRef>(null);

  const onMapLoad = useCallback(() => {
    mapRef.current.on('move', () => {
      // do something
    });
  }, []);

  return <Map ref={mapRef} onLoad={onMapLoad} ... />;
}
```


The [MapRef](./types.md#mapref) object exposes Map methods ([Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map-instance-members) | [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/classes/Map/#methods)) that **are safe to call without breaking the React bindings**. For example, `setStyle()` is hidden from the ref object, because the style is supposed to be changed by updating the `mapStyle` prop. Calling the method directly may cause the the React prop to mismatch with the underlying state, and lead to unexpected behaviors.

You can still access the hidden members via `getMap()`:

#### `getMap()` {#getmap}

Returns the native `Map` ([Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) | [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/classes/Map/)) instance associated with this component.
