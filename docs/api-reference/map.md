# Map

React component that wraps [Map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/).

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl';

function App() {
  return <Map
    initialViewState={{
      longitude: -100,
      latitude: 40,
      zoom: 3.5
    }}
    style={{width: '100vw', height: '100vh'}}
    mapStyle="mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9"
    mapboxAccessToken="MY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  />;
}
```

## Methods

Imperative methods are accessible via a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs) or the [useMap](/docs/api-reference/use-map.md) hook.


```js
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl';

function App() {
  const mapRef = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    mapRef.current.on('styleimagemissing', () => {
      // do something
    });
  }, [])

  return <Map ref={mapRef} />;
}
```

The [MapRef](/docs/api-reference/types.md#mapref) object exposes [Map methods](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map-instance-members) that **are safe to call without breaaking the React bindings**. For example, `setStyle()` is hidden from the ref object, because the style is supposed to be changed by updating the `mapStyle` prop. Calling the method directly may cause the the React prop to mismatch with the underlying state, and lead to unexpected behaviors.

You can still access the hidden members via `getMap()`:

#### getMap(): MapboxMap

Returns the native [Map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) instance associated with this component.


## Properties

### Layout options

#### id: string

Map container id.

Light properties of the style. Must conform to the [Light Style Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/#light).

#### mapStyle: [MapboxStyle](/docs/api-reference/types.md#mapboxstyle) | string | Immutable

Default: (empty style)

If `true` , the gl context will be created with [MSAA antialiasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing), which can be useful for antialiasing custom layers.
This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.

#### attributionControl: boolean

Default: `true`

If `true`, an attribution control will be added to the map.

#### baseApiUrl: string

The map's default API URL for requesting tiles, styles, sprites, and glyphs.

#### cooperativeGestures: boolean

Default: `false`

If `true` , scroll zoom will require pressing the ctrl or â key while scrolling to zoom map, and touch pan will require using two fingers while panning to move the map. Touch pitch will require three fingers to activate if enabled.

Only applicable if `attributionControl` is `true`.

#### fadeDuration: number

Controls the duration of the fade-in/fade-out animation for label collisions, in milliseconds. This setting affects all symbol layers. This setting does not affect the duration of runtime styling transitions or raster tile cross-fading.

#### failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat: boolean

Default: `false`

If true, map creation will fail if the implementation determines that the performance of the created WebGL context would be dramatically lower than expected.

#### hash: boolean | string

Default: `false`

If `true`, the map's position (zoom, center latitude, center longitude, bearing, and pitch) will be synced with the hash fragment of the page's URL.
For example, `http://path/to/my/page.html#2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60`.

An additional string may optionally be provided to indicate a parameter-styled hash,
e.g. `http://path/to/my/page.html#map=2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60&foo=bar`, where `foo` is a custom parameter and bar is an arbitrary hash distinct from the map hash.

#### interactive: boolean

Default: `true`

If `false`, no mouse, touch, or keyboard listeners are attached to the map, so it will not respond to input.

#### locale: Record\<string, string\>

Default: `null`

A patch to apply to the default localization table for UI strings, e.g. control tooltips.
The `locale` object maps namespaced UI string IDs to translated strings in the target language; see `src/ui/default_locale.js` for an example with all supported string IDs.
The object may specify all UI strings (thereby adding support for a new translation) or only a subset of strings (thereby patching the default translation table).

#### localFontFamily: string

Default: `null`

Defines a CSS font-family for locally overriding generation of all glyphs. Font settings from the map's style will be ignored, except for font-weight keywords (light/regular/medium/bold). If set, this option overrides the setting in localIdeographFontFamily.

#### localIdeographFontFamily: string

Default: `'sans-serif'`

Defines a CSS font-family for locally overriding generation of glyphs in the 'CJK Unified Ideographs', 'Hiragana', 'Katakana', 'Hangul Syllables' and 'CJK Symbols and Punctuation' ranges. Overrides font settings from the map's style. See [example](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/local-ideographs).

Default: `true`

If `false`, the map's pitch (tilt) control with "drag to rotate" interaction will be disabled.

#### preserveDrawingBuffer: boolean

Default: `false`

If `true`, The maps canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`;. This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.

#### refreshExpiredTiles: boolean

Default: `true`

If `false`, the map won't attempt to re-request tiles once they expire per their HTTP `cacheControl`/`expires` headers.

#### RTLTextPlugin: string

Default: `'https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/mapbox-gl-rtl-text/v0.2.3/mapbox-gl-rtl-text.js'`

Sets the map's [RTL text plugin](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/#mapbox-gl-rtl-text). Necessary for supporting the Arabic and Hebrew languages, which are written right-to-left.

Setting this prop is the equivelant of calling [mapboxgl.setRTLTextPlugin](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/properties/#setrtltextplugin) with `lazy: true`.

#### transformRequest: [TransformRequestFunction](/docs/api-reference/types.md#transformrequestfunction)

#### workerClass: object

Default: `null`

Provides an interface for external module bundlers such as Webpack or Rollup to package mapbox-gl's WebWorker into a separate class and integrate it with the library.
Takes precedence over `workerUrl`.

#### workerCount: number

Default: `2`

The number of web workers instantiated on a page with mapbox-gl maps.

#### workerUrl: string

Provides an interface for loading mapbox-gl's WebWorker bundle from a self-hosted URL. This is useful if your site needs to operate in a strict CSP (Content Security Policy) environment wherein you are not allowed to load JavaScript code from a Blob URL, which is default behavior.
