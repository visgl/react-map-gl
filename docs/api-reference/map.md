# default (Map)

React component that wraps [Map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/). This is also the default export from react-map-gl.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl';

function App() {
  return <Map
    mapLib={import('mapbox-gl')}
    initialViewState={{
      longitude: -100,
      latitude: 40,
      zoom: 3.5
    }}
    style={{width: '100vw', height: '100vh'}}
    mapStyle="mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9"
    mapboxAccessToken="MY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  />;
}
```

## Methods

Imperative methods are accessible via a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs) or the [useMap](./use-map.md) hook.


```js
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl';

function App() {
  const mapRef = React.useRef();

  const onMapLoad = React.useCallback(() => {
    mapRef.current.on('move', () => {
      // do something
    });
  }, []);

  return <Map mapLib={import('mapbox-gl')} ref={mapRef} onLoad={onMapLoad} />;
}
```

The [MapRef](./types.md#mapref) object exposes [Map methods](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map-instance-members) that **are safe to call without breaking the React bindings**. For example, `setStyle()` is hidden from the ref object, because the style is supposed to be changed by updating the `mapStyle` prop. Calling the method directly may cause the the React prop to mismatch with the underlying state, and lead to unexpected behaviors.

You can still access the hidden members via `getMap()`:

#### `getMap()`: MapboxMap {#getmap}

Returns the native [Map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) instance associated with this component.

#### `antialias`: boolean {#antialias}

Default: `false`

If `true` , the gl context will be created with [MSAA antialiasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing), which can be useful for antialiasing custom layers.
This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.

#### `attributionControl`: boolean {#attributioncontrol}

Default: `true`

If `true`, an attribution control will be added to the map.

#### `collectResourceTiming`: boolean {#collectresourcetiming}

Default: `false`

If `true`, Resource Timing API information will be collected for requests made by GeoJSON and Vector Tile web workers (this information is normally inaccessible from the main Javascript thread). Information will be returned in a `resourceTiming` property of  relevant `data` events.

#### `cooperativeGestures`: boolean {#cooperativegestures}

Default: `false`

If `true` , scroll zoom will require pressing the ctrl or â key while scrolling to zoom map, and touch pan will require using two fingers while panning to move the map. Touch pitch will require three fingers to activate if enabled.

#### `crossSourceCollisions`: boolean {#crosssourcecollisions}

String or strings to show in an AttributionControl.
Only applicable if `attributionControl` is `true`.

#### `fadeDuration`: number {#fadeduration}

Controls the duration of the fade-in/fade-out animation for label collisions, in milliseconds. This setting affects all symbol layers. This setting does not affect the duration of runtime styling transitions or raster tile cross-fading.

#### `failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat`: boolean {#failifmajorperformancecaveat}

Default: `false`

If true, map creation will fail if the implementation determines that the performance of the created WebGL context would be dramatically lower than expected.

#### `hash`: boolean | string {#hash}

Default: `false`

If `true`, the map's position (zoom, center latitude, center longitude, bearing, and pitch) will be synced with the hash fragment of the page's URL.
For example, `http://path/to/my/page.html#2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60`.

An additional string may optionally be provided to indicate a parameter-styled hash,
e.g. `http://path/to/my/page.html#map=2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60&foo=bar`, where `foo` is a custom parameter and bar is an arbitrary hash distinct from the map hash.

#### `interactive`: boolean {#interactive}

Default: `true`

If `false`, no mouse, touch, or keyboard listeners are attached to the map, so it will not respond to input.

#### `locale`: Record\<string, string\> {#locale}

Default: `null`

A patch to apply to the default localization table for UI strings, e.g. control tooltips.
The `locale` object maps namespaced UI string IDs to translated strings in the target language; see `src/ui/default_locale.js` for an example with all supported string IDs.
The object may specify all UI strings (thereby adding support for a new translation) or only a subset of strings (thereby patching the default translation table).

#### `localFontFamily`: string {#localfontfamily}

Default: `null`

Defines a CSS font-family for locally overriding generation of all glyphs. Font settings from the map's style will be ignored, except for font-weight keywords (light/regular/medium/bold). If set, this option overrides the setting in localIdeographFontFamily.

Default: `'sans-serif'`

Defines a CSS font-family for locally overriding generation of glyphs in the 'CJK Unified Ideographs', 'Hiragana', 'Katakana', 'Hangul Syllables' and 'CJK Symbols and Punctuation' ranges. Overrides font settings from the map's style. See [example](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/local-ideographs).

#### `logoPosition`: 'top-left' | 'top-right' | 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-right' {#logoposition}

If true, map will prioritize rendering for performance by reordering layers.
If false, layers will always be drawn in the specified order.

#### `pitchWithRotate`: boolean {#pitchwithrotate}

Default: `true`

If `false`, the map's pitch (tilt) control with "drag to rotate" interaction will be disabled.

#### `preserveDrawingBuffer`: boolean {#preservedrawingbuffer}

Default: `false`

If `true`, The maps canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`;. This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.

#### `refreshExpiredTiles`: boolean {#refreshexpiredtiles}

Default: `true`

If `false`, the map won't attempt to re-request tiles once they expire per their HTTP `cacheControl`/`expires` headers.

#### `reuseMaps`: boolean {#reusemaps}

Default: `false`

By default, every time a map component is unmounted, all internal resources associated with the underlying `Map` instance are released. If the map gets mounted again, a new `Map` instance is constructed.

If `reuseMaps` is set to `true`, when a map component is unmounted, the underlying `Map` instance is retained in memory. The next time a map component gets mounted, the saved instance is reused. This behavior may be desirable if an application frequently mounts/unmounts map(s), for example in a tabbed or collapsable UI, and wants to avoid [new billable events](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/releases/tag/v2.0.0) triggered by initialization.

Note that since some map options cannot be modified after initialization, when reusing maps, only the reactive props and `initialViewState` of the new component are respected.

#### `RTLTextPlugin`: string {#rtltextplugin}

Default: `'https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/mapbox-gl-rtl-text/v0.2.3/mapbox-gl-rtl-text.js'`

Sets the map's [RTL text plugin](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/#mapbox-gl-rtl-text). Necessary for supporting the Arabic and Hebrew languages, which are written right-to-left.

Setting this prop is the equivelant of calling [mapboxgl.setRTLTextPlugin](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/properties/#setrtltextplugin) with `lazy: true`.

#### `testMode`: boolean {#testmode}

Default: `false`

Silences errors and warnings generated due to an invalid accessToken, useful when using the library to write unit tests.

#### `trackResize`: boolean {#trackresize}

Default: `true`

If `true`, the map will automatically resize when the browser window resizes.

#### `transformRequest`: [TransformRequestFunction](./types.md#transformrequestfunction) {#transformrequest}

Default: `null`

A callback run before the Map makes a request for an external URL. The callback can be used to modify the url, set headers, or set the credentials property for cross-origin requests.

#### `workerClass`: object {#workerclass}

Default: `null`

Provides an interface for external module bundlers such as Webpack or Rollup to package mapbox-gl's WebWorker into a separate class and integrate it with the library.
Takes precedence over `workerUrl`.

#### `workerCount`: number {#workercount}

Default: `2`

The number of web workers instantiated on a page with mapbox-gl maps.

#### `workerUrl`: string {#workerurl}

Provides an interface for loading mapbox-gl's WebWorker bundle from a self-hosted URL. This is useful if your site needs to operate in a strict CSP (Content Security Policy) environment wherein you are not allowed to load JavaScript code from a Blob URL, which is default behavior.
