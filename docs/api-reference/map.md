# Map

![Since v7.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/since-v7.0-green)

React component that wraps [Map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/).

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl';

function App() {
  return <Map
    initialViewState={{
      longitude: -100,
      latitude: 40,
      zoom: 3.5
    }}
    style={{width: '100vw', height: '100vh'}}
    mapStyle="mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9"
    mapboxAccessToken="MY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  />;
}
```

## Methods

The following methods are accessible via a [React ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs) or the [useMap](/docs/api-reference/use-map.md) hook.


```js
import * as React from 'react';
import Map from 'react-map-gl';

function App() {
  const mapRef = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const mapboxMap = mapRef.current.getMap();
    console.log(`mapbox-gl v${mapboxMap.version}`);
  }, [])

  return <Map ref={mapRef} ... />;
}
```

#### getMap(): MapboxMap

Returns the underlying [Map](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) instance.

#### getViewState(): ViewState

Returns the current view state of the map.

## Properties

### Layout options

Conic projections such as Albers and Lambert have configurable `center` and `parallels` properties that allow developers to define the region in which the projection has minimal distortion; see [example](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#setprojection).

### Other options

Props in this section are not reactive. They are only used once when the Map instance is constructed.

#### mapboxAccessToken: string

Token used to access the Mapbox data service. See [about map tokens](/docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens.md).

#### antialias: boolean

Default: `false`

If `true` , the gl context will be created with [MSAA antialiasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing), which can be useful for antialiasing custom layers.
This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.

#### attributionControl: boolean

Default: `true`

If `true`, an attribution control will be added to the map.

#### bearingSnap: number

Default: `7`

Snap to north threshold in degrees.

#### clickTolerance: number

Default: `3`

The max number of pixels a user can shift the mouse pointer during a click for it to be considered a valid click (as opposed to a mouse drag).

#### collectResourceTiming: boolean

Default: `false`

If `true`, Resource Timing API information will be collected for requests made by GeoJSON and Vector Tile web workers (this information is normally inaccessible from the main Javascript thread). Information will be returned in a `resourceTiming` property of  relevant `data` events.

#### cooperativeGestures: boolean

Default: `false`

If `true` , scroll zoom will require pressing the ctrl or â key while scrolling to zoom map, and touch pan will require using two fingers while panning to move the map. Touch pitch will require three fingers to activate if enabled.

#### crossSourceCollisions: boolean

Default: `true`

If `true`, symbols from multiple sources can collide with each other during collision detection. If `false`, collision detection is run separately for the symbols in each source.

#### customAttribution: string | string[]

Default: `null`

String or strings to show in an AttributionControl.
Only applicable if `attributionControl` is `true`.

#### fadeDuration: number

Default: `300`

Controls the duration of the fade-in/fade-out animation for label collisions, in milliseconds. This setting affects all symbol layers. This setting does not affect the duration of runtime styling transitions or raster tile cross-fading.

#### failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat: boolean

Default: `false`

If true, map creation will fail if the implementation determines that the performance of the created WebGL context would be dramatically lower than expected.

#### hash: boolean | string

Default: `false`

If `true`, the map's position (zoom, center latitude, center longitude, bearing, and pitch) will be synced with the hash fragment of the page's URL.
For example, `http://path/to/my/page.html#2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60`.

An additional string may optionally be provided to indicate a parameter-styled hash,
e.g. `http://path/to/my/page.html#map=2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60&foo=bar`, where `foo` is a custom parameter and bar is an arbitrary hash distinct from the map hash.

#### interactive: boolean

Default: `true`

If `false`, no mouse, touch, or keyboard listeners are attached to the map, so it will not respond to input.

#### locale: Record\<string, string\>

Default: `null`

A patch to apply to the default localization table for UI strings, e.g. control tooltips.
The `locale` object maps namespaced UI string IDs to translated strings in the target language; see `src/ui/default_locale.js` for an example with all supported string IDs.
The object may specify all UI strings (thereby adding support for a new translation) or only a subset of strings (thereby patching the default translation table).

#### localFontFamily: string

Default: `null`

Defines a CSS font-family for locally overriding generation of all glyphs. Font settings from the map's style will be ignored, except for font-weight keywords (light/regular/medium/bold). If set, this option overrides the setting in localIdeographFontFamily.

#### localIdeographFontFamily: string

Default: `'sans-serif'`

Defines a CSS font-family for locally overriding generation of glyphs in the 'CJK Unified Ideographs', 'Hiragana', 'Katakana', 'Hangul Syllables' and 'CJK Symbols and Punctuation' ranges. Overrides font settings from the map's style. See [example](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/local-ideographs).

If true, map will prioritize rendering for performance by reordering layers.
If false, layers will always be drawn in the specified order.

#### pitchWithRotate: boolean

Default: `true`

#### preserveDrawingBuffer: boolean

Default: `false`

If `true`, The maps canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`;. This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.

#### refreshExpiredTiles: boolean

Default: `true`

If `false`, the map won't attempt to re-request tiles once they expire per their HTTP `cacheControl`/`expires` headers.

#### testMode: boolean

Default: `false`

Silences errors and warnings generated due to an invalid accessToken, useful when using the library to write unit tests.

#### trackResize: boolean

Default: `true`
