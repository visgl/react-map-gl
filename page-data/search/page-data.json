Library Description MapLibre An open fork of mapbox-gl v1, that can be used without a mapbox token. Mapbox GL JS v1 The previous version of mapbox GL JS. This version is free open source and can be used with non-mapbox basemaps without a mapbox token. Mapbox GL JS v2 The latest version of Mapbox GL JS. Note that version 2 is not free open source, and a mapbox token is required and billable events are generated even if you do not use mapbox hosted basemaps. Other mapbox-gl forks It may be possible to use react-map-gl with other mapbox forks, but this is not a supported use case. Minor PRs to enable other forks to be used may be accepted. For basemaps: You can load map data from Mapbox's own service. You can create and host your own map data using one of the many  open source tools . New to react-map-gl?  Get Started Want to contribute? See our  Developer Guide Design Philosophy At Uber, we make powerful web tools that contain maps. To manage the complexity of our applications, we fully embrace React and reactive programming. The stock mapbox-gl APIs are  imperative . That is, you instruct the map to do something (for example,  map.flyTo ), and it will execute the command at its own pace. This does not scale when we have many components that need to synchronize with each other. One use case we have is to render two maps side by side, and when the user interacts with one, update both cameras. We draw UI on top of the map using React, pinned to a given geolocation. We also render visualization layers on top of the map using WebGL, most notably with  deck.gl . The mapbox maps, the deck.gl canvas, and React controls' render cycles are all asynchronous. If we listen to the  move  event in the map and tell the other components to update, the other components would always be one frame behind. Ultimately, in the spirit of the  reactive programming paradigm , data always flows  down . In a complex application, any user input or data fetch can affect the rendering of many components. We might store the  source of truth  in a parent component state, or Redux store, or hooks, and let it propagate down to the map as well as its peers. As long as the map manages its own state, as mapbox-gl is designed to do, we risk the components going out of sync. react-map-gl creates a fully reactive wrapper for mapbox-gl. The  InteractiveMap  component is stateless. To move the map camera in anyway, the application must update the component's props. The application can also be confident that the map's camera would never deviate from the props that it's assigned. At first glance, its API may seem verbose to those who come from the imperative world of mapbox-gl. However, it is essential for the correctness of large applications. Limitations This library provides convenient wrappers around initializing and (to some degree) tracking the state of a Mapbox WebGL map. Because most of the functionality of Mapbox's JS API depends on the use of HTML5 canvases and WebGL, which React is not built to manipulate, the React component does not mirror all the functionality of Mapbox GL JS's Map class. You may access the native Mapbox API exposed by the  getMap()  function in this library. However, proceed with caution as calling the native APIs may break the connection between the React layer props and the underlying map state. Examples of replacing common native API calls with their React equivalents can be found on the  FAQ  page.","headings":[{"value":"Introduction","depth":1},{"value":"Design Philosophy","depth":2},{"value":"Limitations","depth":2}],"slug":"docs","title":"Introduction"},{"excerpt":"Custom Map Controller Overriding The Default Map Controller To change the default behavior of map interaction, you can provide a custom map control to the  controller  prop of  InteractiveMap .

Instead, transitions can be defined using  InteractiveMap 's transition props. Example: Fly to a New Location See  viewport animation  for a complete example. Example: Transition Viewport To A Bounding Box You can use the  WebMercatorViewport  utility to find the target viewport that fits around a lngLat bounding box: Documentation of WebMercatorViewport Controlling Map Transitions InteractiveMap's Transition Props See properties of  InteractiveMap . transitionDuration  (Number) transitionInterpolator  (Object) transitionEasing  (Function) transitionInterruption  (Number) onTransitionStart  (Function) onTransitionInterrupt  (Function) onTransitionEnd  (Function) Transition and the onViewportChange Callback InteractiveMap  is designed to be a stateless component. For transitions to work, the application must update the viewport props returned by the  onViewportChange  callback: Remarks: The props returned by the callback may contain transition properties. For example, during panning and rotating, the callback is invoked with  transitionDuration: 0 , meaning that the map movement instantly matches the change of the pointer. When panning or zooming with keyboard, the callback is invoked with a 300ms linear transition. It is recommended that when programatically triggering a transition, always explicitly set the transition properties (interpolator, easing and duration). \"Set and forget\": the values of the following props at the start of a transition carry through the entire duration of the transition: transitionDuration transitionInterpolator transitionEasing transitionInterruption The default interaction/transition behavior can always be intercepted and overwritten in the handler for  onViewportChange . However, if a transition is in progress, the properties that are being transitioned (e.g. longitude and latitude) should not be manipulated, otherwise the change will be interpreted as an interruption of the transition. When using  FlyToInterpolator  for  transitionInterpolator ,  transitionDuration  can be set to  'auto'  where actual duration is auto calculated based on start and end viewports and is linear to the distance between them. This duration can be further customized using  speed  parameter to  FlyToInterpolator  constructor. Transition Interpolators A  TransitionInterpolator  instance must be supplied to the  transitionInterpolator  prop. It contains the following methods: arePropsEqual(currentProps, nextProps)  - called to determine if transition should be triggered when viewport props update. initiateProps(startProps, endProps)  - called before transition starts to pre-process the start and end viewport props. interpolateProps(startProps, endProps, t)  - called to get viewport props in transition.  t  is a time factor between  [0, 1] . react-map-gl offers two built-in interpolator classes: LinearInterpolator FlyToInterpolator","headings":[{"value":"Viewport Transition","depth":1},{"value":"Example: Fly to a New Location","depth":2},{"value":"Example: Transition Viewport To A Bounding Box","depth":2},{"value":"Controlling Map Transitions","depth":2},{"value":"InteractiveMap's Transition Props","depth":3},{"value":"Transition and the onViewportChange Callback","depth":3},{"value":"Transition Interpolators","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/advanced/viewport-transition","title":"Viewport Transition"},{"excerpt":"AttributionControl This is a React equivalent of Mapbox's  AttributionControl .

If  true , shows Mapbox's attribution control. disableTokenWarning  (Boolean) default:  false If the provided API access token is rejected by Mapbox,  StaticMap  renders a warning instead of failing silently. If you know what you are doing and want to hide this warning anyways, set this prop to  true . gl  (WebGLContext) This prop is experimental. Use an existing WebGLContext instead of creating a new one. This allows multiple libraries to render into a shared buffer. Use with caution. mapboxApiAccessToken  (String) Mapbox API access token for  MapboxGL . Required when using Mapbox vector tiles/styles\nMapbox WebGL context creation option. Useful when you want to export the canvas as a PNG mapboxApiUrl  (String) default:  https://api.mapbox.com Enables the use of private and country specific servers Mapbox servers, e.g.  https://api.mapbox.cn/ . mapOptions  (Object) default:  {} Non-public API, see  https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl/issues/545 An object of additional options to be passed to Mapbox's  Map  constructor . Options specified here\nwill take precedence over those same options if set via props. preserveDrawingBuffer  (Boolean) default:  false Equivalent to Mapbox's  preserveDrawingBuffer   option . If  true , the map's canvas can be exported to a PNG using  map.getCanvas().toDataURL() . preventStyleDiffing  (Boolean) default:  false If  mapStyle  is assigned an Immutable object, when the prop changes,  StaticMap  can diff between the two values and call the appropriate Mapbox API such as  addLayer ,  removeLayer ,  setStyle ,  setData , etc.\nThis allows apps to update data sources and layer styles efficiently. In use cases such as animation or dynamic showing/hiding layers, style diffing prevents the map from reloading and flickering when the map style changes. There are known issues with style diffing. As stopgap, use this option to prevent style diffing. reuseMaps  (Boolean) default:  false This prop is experimental. If  true , when the map component is unmounted, instead of calling  remove  on the Mapbox map instance, save it for later reuse. This will avoid repeatedly creating new Mapbox map instances if possible. Applications that frequently mount and unmount maps may try this prop to help work around a mapbox-gl resource leak issue that can lead to a browser crash in certain situations. transformRequest  (Function) default:  null A callback run before the Map makes a request for an external URL. The callback can be used to modify the url, set headers, or set the credentials property for cross-origin requests.\nExpected to return an object with a  url  property and optionally  headers  and  credentials  properties.

A string url or a\n MapboxGL style \nobject (regular JS object or Immutable.Map). Whenever the  mapStyle  prop changes, the component will attempt to update the style of the underlying Mapbox map. The behavior can be further customized with the  preventStyleDiffing  prop. mapStyle  is ignored when explicitly set to  null . width  (Number | String, required) The width of the map. Can be either a number in pixels, or a valid CSS string. height  (Number | String, required) The height of the map. Can be either a number in pixels, or a valid CSS string. latitude  (Number) The latitude of the center of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if  viewState  is not supplied. longitude  (Number) The longitude of the center of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if  viewState  is not supplied. zoom  (Number) The tile zoom level of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if  viewState  is not supplied. Bounded implicitly by default  minZoom  and  maxZoom  of  MapboxGL bearing  (Number) default:  0 Specify the bearing of the viewport, as a top level prop.

Altitude of the viewport camera, relative to screen height. viewState  (Object) An object containing the view state of the map specified by the following fields: latitude  (Number) - The latitude of the center of the map. longitude  (Number) - The longitude of the center of the map. zoom  (Number) - The tile zoom level of the map. Bounded implicitly by default  minZoom  and  maxZoom  of  MapboxGL . bearing  (Number) - default:  0  - The bearing of the viewport. pitch  (Number) - default:  0  - The pitch of the viewport. altitude  (Number) - default:  1.5 screen heights Note: Either the  viewState , or the  latitude ,  longitude  and  zoom  properties need to be specified.

If  false , force Mapbox canvas to redraw with DOM updates. This will make the map synchronize better with other controls during prop-driven viewport changes. style  (Object) The CSS style of the map container. visible  (Boolean) default:  true Whether the map is visible. Unmounting and re-mounting a Mapbox instance is known to be costly. This option offers a way to hide a map using CSS style. visibilityConstraints  (Object) An object that specifies bounds for viewport props with  min* ,  max*  keys. If the viewport props are outside of these constraints, the Mapbox map is automatically hidden. Default:  { minZoom: 0, maxZoom: 20, minPitch: 0, maxPitch: 60 } Callbacks onLoad  (Function) default:  () => {} A callback run when the map emits a  load  event.

The experimental  _MapContext  export will be removed in a future release. react-virtualized-auto-sizer  is no longer a dependency. Inertia has been enabled by default on the map controller. To revert to the behavior in previous versions, set the  interaction options : Source  and  Layer  components no longer expose imperative methods via  ref  as part of the migration to functional components. This is to comply with the pattern recommended by the latest React. If you used to call  sourceRef.getSource() , it can be replaced with  mapRef().getMap().getSource(sourceId) . If you used to call  layerRef.getLayer() , it can be replaced with  mapRef().getMap().getLayer(layerId) . Upgrading to v6 A valid Mapbox access token is always required. The default value of  InteractiveMap 's  maxPitch  prop is changed to  85  from  60 . mapbox-gl  v2 introduced a breaking change to the build system. Transpiling it may result in a crash in the production build with the message  m is not defined . Find solutions in  this thread . Upgrading to v4 onChangeViewport  is removed, use  onViewportChange  instead Immutable.js  is no longer a dependency Export  experimental.MapControls  is removed, use  MapController  instead InteractiveMap 's  mapControls  prop is renamed to  controller Removed support for the deprecated  interactive  property on the layer styles. Use the  interactiveLayerIds  prop to specify which layers are clickable. Upgrading to v3.2 The latest mapbox-gl release requires stylesheet to be included at all times. See  Get Started  for information about styling. Immutable.js is no longer a hard dependency and will be removed in the next major release. If you are importing immutable in your application, it is recommended that you explicitly list it in the application's dependencies. Upgrading to v3 v3 is a major upgrade of react-map-gl. While we have tried to gently deprecated any changed or removed features, a few breaking changes could not be avoided. Version Requirements The  Node Version Requirement  for  building  react-map-gl is now  >=v6.4.0 . Using prebuilt react-map-gl does  NOT  has this limitation. This is introduced by  Mapbox GL JS v0.38.0 MapGL Component Two Map Components  - v3 now splits the Map component into two React components:  StaticMap  and  InteractiveMap .  InteractiveMap  is the default export, and designed to be as compatible as possible with the v2 default component. onChangeViewport  callback now includes  width  and  height . The  viewport  parameter passed to the  onChangeViewport  callback now includes  width  and  height . Application code that composed the  viewport  with  width  and  height  may have to be updated. Please double check your render code if you relied on this behavior. Overlays Some Overlays Moved to Examples  -  Some less frequently used overlays ( DraggablePointsOverlay ,  ChoroplethOverlay ,  ScatterplotOverlay ), have been moved to examples. Most users are now using mapbox styles or deck.gl layers and removing these overlays reduces the size of the react-map-gl library for the majority of users that don't need them. If you still use them, simply copy the overlay source file(s) into your application. Overlays must be Children of the Map  - Overlays  must  now be rendered as children of the main  react-map-gl  component to automatically sync with the map viewport. fitBounds  utility function The  fitBounds  utility has been moved to the  math.gl  library. The function can now be called as follows: Deprecations We have started to deprecate a few React props. In all the cases below, the old  props  will still work (you'll get a warning in the console), but they will likely be removed in the next major version of react-map-gl so you should start using the new  props  as soon as possible. Old Prop New Prop onChangeViewport(<viewport>) onViewportChange(<viewport>) onHoverFeatures(<features>) onHover(<event>) onClickFeatures(<features>) onClick(<event>) perspectiveEnabled [default: false] dragRotate [default: true] Upgrading to v2 v2 is API compatible with v1, however if you are still using  v1  of react-map-gl, make sure that you first upgrade: Your  node  version to  v4  or higher Your  react  version to  15.4  or higher. Background:  mapbox-gl  0.31.0 introduced a hard dependency on Node >= v4. Upgrading to v1 (Upgrading from 0.6.x) Importing Overlays  - The map overlay components ( HTMLOverlay ,  CanvasOverlay ,  SVGOverlay  etc) are now named exports. They previously had to be imported via their relative source paths: Map State  - The map state reported by  onViewportChanged  will now contain additional state fields (tracking not only  pitch  and  bearing  needed for perspective mode, but also transient information about how the projection is being changed by the user). This information must be passed back to the react-map-gl component in the next render. To simplify and future proof applications, it is recommended to simply save the entire  mapState  in your app store whenever it changes and then pass it back to the component rather than trying to keep track of individual fields (like  longitude ,  latitude  and  zoom ).","headings":[{"value":"Upgrade Guide","depth":1},{"value":"Upgrading to v5.3/v6.1","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v6","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v4","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v3.2","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v3","depth":2},{"value":"Version Requirements","depth":3},{"value":"MapGL Component","depth":3},{"value":"onChangeViewport callback now includes width and height.","depth":4},{"value":"Overlays","depth":3},{"value":"fitBounds utility function","depth":3},{"value":"Deprecations","depth":3},{"value":"Upgrading to v2","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v1","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/upgrade-guide","title":"Upgrade Guide"},{"excerpt":"What's new react-map-gl v5.3/v6.1 Release date: Jan 27, 2020 Highlights TypeScript and Flow typings  are now published with the library More controller customizations.  Smooth easing on wheel scroll, three-finger gesture to change pitch, inertia after pan/pinch, and customizable keyboard navigation speed. See the updated  interaction options  for details.

There are  important changes  to mapbox-gl's license and pricing model in this milestone. If you are NOT using a Mapbox account (e.g. self-hosting map tiles), do  NOT  upgrade to this version, and consider your options discussed in  this document . See  upgrade guide  for a complete list of breaking changes. react-map-gl v5.2 Release date: Jan 6, 2020 Highlights New Components :  ScaleControl NavigationControl : new  label  prop GeolocateControl : new  label ,  onGeolocate ,  auto  props New Export :  WebMercatorViewport  is re-exported from the  viewport-mercator-project  library for ease of use. It's recommended to import it from  react-map-gl  instead to avoid future dependency change. New Example :  Clusters react-map-gl v5.1 Release date: Oct 30, 2019 Highlights New Components :  Layer  and  Source  have been added to provide better React parity with the  Mapbox GL JS  API. Viewport transition :  transitionDuration  can be set to  'auto'  when using  FlyToInterpolator . New Example : Add an  example  with drawing library  react-map-gl-draw . react-map-gl v5.0 Release date: May 31, 2019 What's Changed The only change between the 5.0 release and the latest 4.1 release is Mapbox GL JS v1.0. By using this version, you opt into Mapbox's new pricing model, which bills per map load instead of map views. 5.0.x and 4.1.x will continue to update in parallel with otherwise identical features until November 2019 when Mapbox moves all users of 0.xx to a new pricing scheme. For more details, see mapbox's  changelog  and  blog post . Alongside Mapbox GL JS's new milestone, we have relaxed the  mapbox-gl  dependency from locking minor release ( ~0.53.0 ) to major release ( ^1.0.0 ). This will allow developers to upgrade faster without waiting for a new release from react-map-gl. react-map-gl v4.1 Release date: Mar 14, 2019 Highlights New Components :  FullscreenControl ,  GeolocateControl  have been added to provide better React parity with the  Mapbox GL JS  API. New callback props   InteractiveMap  supports more callbacks: onNativeClick react-map-gl v4.0 Release date: Nov 5, 2018 Highlights Relative dimensions  Both  InteractiveMap  and  StaticMap  now support CSS strings supplied to map  width  and  height  props. New  onResize  callback is fired when the map resizes. React 16  Upgrade to React 16.3 context and ref patterns Babel 7  Upgrade build system to Babel 7, better support for tree-shaking Style diffing  Now use Mapbox's native style diffing. Immutable is no longer required. Draggable Markers   Marker  component now supports a new prop  draggable , along with callbacks  onDragStart ,  onDrag , and  onDragEnd . 3d Popups   Popup  component now supports a new prop  sortByDepth  to enable proper occlusion when multiple popups are used in a tilted map. Interaction states   onViewportChange  is now called with richer descriptors of the user interaction, including  isPanning ,  isZooming  and  isRotating . Interactive layers  Dropped the requirement for the deprecated  interactive  property on the layer styles. Use the  interactiveLayerIds  prop to specify which layers are clickable. New callback props   InteractiveMap  supports more callbacks: onDblClick onMouseDown onMouseMove onMouseUp onTouchStart onTouchMove onTouchEnd onMouseEnter onMouseLeave onWheel onMouseOut See  upgrade guide  for breaking changes. react-map-gl v3.3 Release date: July, 2018 Highlights New  viewState  Property : Makes it possible to specify all map state properties ( longitude ,  latitude ,  zoom ,  bearing  and  pitch ) as a single property. New  onViewStateChange  callback : An alternative callback that matches the new  viewState  prop. react-map-gl v3.2 Realease date: January, 2018 Highlights Viewport transition : feature equivalent to Mapbox's flyTo and easeTo; smooth transition when using keyboard navigation or the NavigationControl. Better parity of Mapbox interaction : navigation using keyboard and the navigation control matches Mapbox behavior, including smooth transition when zooming and panning. Support for Map Reuse (experimental) : A new property  reuseMaps  is provided for applications that create and destroy maps, to help work around a mapbox-gl resource leak issue that can lead to a browser crash in certain situations. mapbox-gl 0.42.2 New props  of the InteractiveMap component: Map creation:  transformRequest ,  reuseMaps Interaction:  touchZoom ,  touchRotate Transition:  transitionDuration ,  transitionInterpolator ,  transitionEasing ,  transitionInterruption ,  onTransitionStart ,  onTransitionInterrupt ,  onTransitionEnd react-map-gl v3.1 Release date: October 19, 2017 Highlights Event handling Support right mouse drag to rotate Support keyboard navigation Allow controls and overlays to block map interactions React 16  - react-map-gl is now being tested with React 16, but the React peer dependency requirement is unchanged at  >=15.4.x . mapbox-gl v0.40.1 No Token warning : react-map-gl now renders an HTML message if no mapbox token is supplied. react-map-gl v3.0 Release date: July 27th, 2017 Highlights Latest Mapbox GL JS : Bumps  Mapbox GL JS  to  0.38 . Multi-Touch Support : Full support for multi-touch gestures such as pinch-to-zoom and rotate. New Components : The  MapGL  component has been split into  StaticMap  and  InteractiveMap  (the default). Also,  Popup ,  Marker ,  NavigationControl  have been added to provide better React parity with the  Mapbox GL JS  API. Improved Overlay Components : Supplying viewport props ( width   height   zoom   longitude  and  latitude ) are no longer required if you render  SVGOverlay ,  CanvasOverlay  or  HTMLOverlay  as a child of the map. Perspective mode is now supported in all overlays. New Props :  maxPitch ,  minPitch ,  dragPan ,  doubleClickZoom ,  touchZoomRotate ,\n scrollZoom  are now provided to allow granular control of map interactivity. Documentation : Significantly expanded and linked with our other geospatial frameworks. Examples : New stand-alone examples to get you started instantly with the new features. Event Handling : New event handling architecture that enables full customization of event handling (experimental). Components InteractiveMap (New, MapGL replacement) This is a wrapper on top of  StaticMap . It takes all the props of  StaticMap  and additional ones such as  onViewportChange ,  scrollZoom ,  dragRotate , etc. to control interactivity on the map. See  Source Code  for more information. StaticMap (New) This is the React wrapper around  Mapbox GL JS  and takes in viewport properties such as  width ,  height ,  latitude ,  longitude . Style diffing and updating logic also live here. See  Source Code  for more information. Overlays Three overlays ( ScatterplotOverlay ,  DraggablePointsOverlay ,  ChoroplethOverlay ), have been moved out of the library and are now only provided as examples. Property Changes Property Names  - some prop names have been modernized, the old ones will still work for now with a warning. Internal Properties  such as  isHovering ,  isDragging ,  startDragLngLat  have been removed.\nThese were never meant to be useful publicly and have caused confusions in the past. Utilities fitBounds :  fitBounds  has been moved to another repository and has been rewritten to provide a more logical interface. For more information, see the  Upgrade Guide . react-map-gl v2.0 Date: Jan 17, 2017 Highlights Latest mapbox-gl : Bump  mapbox-gl  to v0.31.0 new maxZoom prop  - Add  maxZoom  prop and defaults to  20 New onLoad prop  - Add  onLoad  event handler new onClick prop  - Add  onClick  prop handler (#140) react-map-gl v1.0 Perspective Mode  - Now supports  bearing  and  pitch  properties, per mapbox-gl api documentation. These props default to 0 which means that maps will still be rendered in flat/ortographic mode when they are not provided Support for ES6 imports  - The map overlay components (HTMLOverlay, CanvasOverlay, SVGOverlay etc) previously had to be imported via their relative source paths can now be imported directly using `import {SVGOverlay} from 'react-map-gl'. react-map-gl v0.6 Initial public version","headings":[{"value":"What's new","depth":1},{"value":"react-map-gl v5.3/v6.1","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v6.0","depth":2},{"value":"What's Changed","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v5.2","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v5.1","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v5.0","depth":2},{"value":"What's Changed","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v4.1","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v4.0","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v3.3","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v3.2","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v3.1","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v3.0","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"Components","depth":3},{"value":"InteractiveMap (New, MapGL replacement)","depth":4},{"value":"StaticMap (New)","depth":4},{"value":"Overlays","depth":4},{"value":"Property Changes","depth":3},{"value":"Utilities","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v2.0","depth":2},{"value":"Highlights","depth":3},{"value":"react-map-gl v1.0","depth":2},{"value":"react-map-gl v0.6","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/whats-new","title":"What's new"},{"excerpt":"Adding Custom Data Native Mapbox Layers You can inject data and mapbox native layers using the  Source  and  Layer  components: For details about data sources and layer configuration, check out the  Mapbox style specification .

The export mainly offers a convenience when using server-side rendering. To use this API, consult Mapbox's  setRTLTextPlugin  documentation. Where is fitBounds? You can use the  WebMercatorViewport  utility to find the target viewport that fits around a longitude-latitude bounding box: Documentation of WebMercatorViewport I called flyTo/panTo and all controls went out of sync You cannot manipulate the map camera via  getMap()  and the native mapbox-gl API. To conform to the reactive programming paradigm, all camera changes should be driven by prop changes on the React component. Circumventing this will break the binding between React components and the underlying map instance. Instead, use the  InteractiveMap 's transition props. See  viewport transition  for examples. mapbox-gl-draw does not work with react-map-gl Unfortunately, react-map-gl implements its own interative logic and disables the native event handling of mapbox-gl. Short explanation: mapbox-gl is not designed to support React. Long explanation: When using react-map-gl, we have two asynchronous rendering loops, React and Mapbox. Mapbox's  move  events are only fired after the camera changes and there is no way to control how and when the map rerenders. If we update React states upon the  move  events, all React controls/overlays may only get updated one animation frame after the map rerender. You can find discussions  here  and  here . Because of this, any mapbox-gl control that listens to the native map events will not work. An equivelant to mapbox-gl-draw is  react-map-gl-draw . You can find an example  here .","headings":[{"value":"FAQ","depth":1},{"value":"Enable Right-to-Left Language Support","depth":2},{"value":"Where is fitBounds?","depth":2},{"value":"I called flyTo/panTo and all controls went out of sync","depth":2},{"value":"mapbox-gl-draw does not work with react-map-gl","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/get-started/faq","title":"FAQ"},{"excerpt":"Get Started Installation Using  react-map-gl  requires  node >= v4  and  react >= 16.3 . Example See full project setup in  get-started examples Styling The current mapbox-gl release requires its stylesheet be included at all times. The marker, popup and navigation components in react-map-gl also need the stylesheet to work properly. You may add the stylesheet to the head of your page: Find out your mapbox version by running  yarn list mapbox-gl  or  npm ls mapbox-gl . Or embed it in your app by using -  browserify-css \nwith Browserify or -  css-loader  with Webpack: Using with Browserify, Webpack, and other JavaScript Bundlers browserify  - react-map-gl is extensively tested with  browserify  and works without configuration. webpack  - Most of the provided react-map-gl examples use webpack.

It provides a React wrapper for  mapbox-gl  or derived projects.\nDepending on which Mapbox GL JS version (or fork) you use, you may need a Mapbox token. You will need a Mapbox token if you use: react-map-gl@>=6.0.0 , depending on  mapbox-gl@>=2.0.0  and above - requires a mapbox access token in order to access the map renderer, and generates billable events regardlesss of whether you are displaying your own maps. react-map-gl@5.x , depending on  mapbox-gl@1.x  - requires an access token only if you load the map styles and tiles from Mapbox's data service. See \"Display Maps Without A Mapbox Token\" section below for using non-Mapbox tiles. To get a Mapbox token, you will need to register on  their website . The token will be used to identify you and start serving up map tiles. The service is free until a certain level of traffic is exceeded. There are several ways to provide a token to your app, as showcased in some of the example folders: Provide a  mapboxApiAccessToken  prop to the map component Set the  MapboxAccessToken  environment variable (or set  REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN  if you are using Create React App) Provide it in the URL, e.g  ?access_token=TOKEN Provide  mapboxApiUrl  prop to the map component to override the default mapbox API URL But we would recommend using something like  dotenv  and put your key in an untracked  .env  file, that will then expose it as a  process.env  variable, with much less leaking risks. Display Maps Without A Mapbox Token It is possible to use the map component without the Mapbox service, if you use another tile source (for example, if you host your own map tiles). Note that this is no longer allowed using mapbox-gl v2.0 and above. The options are: Stay on  react-map-gl@5.x  and  mapbox-gl@1.x . react-map-gl plans to continue supporting this release in the foreseeable future, however, this version will not include any of the latest features of the map renderer, nor get any future updates from Mapbox. Use a community fork of mapbox-gl, for example  maplibre-gl . See  using with a mapbox-gl fork  for how to configure your project. To use your own map service, you will need a custom Mapbox GL style that points to your own  vector tile source , and pass it to  ReactMapGL  using the  mapStyle  prop. This custom style must match the schema of your tile source. Open source tile schemas include: TileZen schema OpenMapTiles schema  Some useful resources for creating your own map service: Mapbox Vector Tile Spec Open source tools If you are using a third party service that requires header based authentication, you can do this by defining a function to pass to  ReactMapGL  using the  transformRequest  prop.

Its appearance is entirely controlled by the properties that are passed in from its parent. In this architecture, transition works the same way as interaction: the component shall notify the application of \"user intent\" by calling the  onViewportChange  callback, but ultimately the application needs to decide what to do with it. The most simple handling of this intent is to save it and pass it back to the component: User interaction and transition will not work without a valid  onViewportChange  handler. The advantage of this practice is that it ensures a single source of truth regarding the viewport state (in the example above, saved in the  state  of the container component). When you use this viewport state to direct the rendering of other components, it is guaranteed that they will always be synced with the map. You may apply additional constraints to the viewport: Or manipulate the viewport outside of the ReactMap component: Using with Redux If you're using redux, it is very easy to hook this component up to store state in the redux state tree.\nThe simplest way is to take all properties passed to the  onViewportChange  function property and add them\ndirectly into the store. This state can then be passed back to the  <ReactMapGL>  component without any transformation.","headings":[{"value":"State Management","depth":1},{"value":"Using with Redux","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/get-started/state-management","title":"State Management"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["484347790"]}
