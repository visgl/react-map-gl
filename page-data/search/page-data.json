It is beautiful, efficient (WebGL-powered), and fully open source. You may load map data from Mapbox's own service, which is free until a certain level of traffic is exceeded; or you can create and host your own map data using one of the many [open source tools](https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles).\n\nNew to react-map-gl? [Get Started](/docs/get-started/get-started.md)\n\nWant to contribute? See our [Developer Guide](/docs/developer-guide.md)\n\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nAt Uber, we make powerful web tools that contain maps. To manage the complexity of our applications, we fully embrace React and reactive programming.\n\nThe stock mapbox-gl APIs are [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming). That is, you instruct the map to do something (for example, [map.flyTo](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#flyto)), and it will execute the command at its own pace.\n\nThis does not scale when we have many components that need to synchronize with each other. One use case we have is to render two maps side by side, and when the user interacts with one, update both cameras. We draw UI on top of the map using React, pinned to a given geolocation. We also render visualization layers on top of the map using WebGL, most notably with [deck.gl](https://deck.gl). The mapbox maps, the deck.gl canvas, and React controls' render cycles are all asynchronous. If we listen to the [move](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map.event:move) event in the map and tell the other components to update, the other components would always be one frame behind.\n\nUltimately, in the spirit of the [reactive programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming), data always flows **down**. In a complex application, any user input or data fetch can affect the rendering of many components. We might store the **source of truth** in a parent component state, or Redux store, or hooks, and let it propagate down to the map as well as its peers. As long as the map manages its own state, as mapbox-gl is designed to do, we risk the components going out of sync.\n\nreact-map-gl creates a fully reactive wrapper for mapbox-gl. The [InteractiveMap](/docs/api-reference/interactive-map) component is stateless. To move the map camera in anyway, the application must update the component's props. The application can also be confident that the map's camera would never deviate from the props that it's assigned. At first glance, its API may seem verbose to those who come from the imperative world of mapbox-gl. However, it is essential for the correctness of large applications.\n\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis library provides convenient wrappers around initializing and (to some degree) tracking the state of a Mapbox WebGL map. Because most of the functionality of Mapbox's JS API depends on the use of HTML5 canvases and WebGL, which React is not built to manipulate, the React component does not mirror all the functionality of Mapbox GL JS's Map class. You may access the native Mapbox API exposed by the [getMap()](/docs/api-reference/static-map.md#getmap) function in this library. However, proceed with caution as calling the native APIs may break the connection between the React layer props and the underlying map state.\n","slug":"docs","title":"Introduction"},{"excerpt":"Developer Guide Develop The dev tools are tested with Node 8.11.3 and yarn 1.7.0.

Use the `interactiveLayerIds` prop to specify which layers are clickable.\n\n## Upgrading to v3.2\n\n- The latest mapbox-gl release requires stylesheet to be included at all times. See [Get Started](/docs/get-started/get-started.md) for information about styling.\n- Immutable.js is no longer a hard dependency and will be removed in the next major release. If you are importing immutable in your application, it is recommended that you explicitly list it in the application's dependencies.\n\n\n## Upgrading to v3\n\nv3 is a major upgrade of react-map-gl. While we have tried to gently deprecated any changed or removed features, a few breaking changes could not be avoided.\n\n\n### Version Requirements\n\n- The **Node Version Requirement** for **building** react-map-gl is now **>=v6.4.0**. Using prebuilt react-map-gl does **NOT** has this limitation. This is introduced by [Mapbox GL JS v0.38.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/releases/tag/v0.38.0)\n\n\n### MapGL Component\n\n* **Two Map Components** - v3 now splits the Map component into two React components: `StaticMap` and `InteractiveMap`. `InteractiveMap` is the default export, and designed to be as compatible as possible with the v2 default component.\n\n\n#### `onChangeViewport` callback now includes `width` and `height`.\n\nThe `viewport` parameter passed to the `onChangeViewport` callback now includes `width` and `height`. Application code that composed the `viewport` with `width` and `height` may have to be updated. Please double check your render code if you relied on this behavior.\n```js\n// BAD: 'width' and 'height' below will be overridden by what's in the 'viewport' object\n<ReactMapGL width={500} height={400} {...viewport} />\n// GOOD: 'width' and 'height' below will override the values in 'viewport'\n<ReactMapGL {...viewport} width={500} height={400} />\n```\n\n### Overlays\n\n* **Some Overlays Moved to Examples** -  Some less frequently used overlays (`DraggablePointsOverlay`, `ChoroplethOverlay`, `ScatterplotOverlay`), have been moved to examples. Most users are now using mapbox styles or deck.gl layers and removing these overlays reduces the size of the react-map-gl library for the majority of users that don't need them. If you still use them, simply copy the overlay source file(s) into your application.\n* **Overlays must be Children of the Map** - Overlays **must** now be rendered as children of the main `react-map-gl` component to automatically sync with the map viewport.\n\n### `fitBounds` utility function\n\nThe `fitBounds` utility has been moved to the [viewport-mercator-project](https://github.com/uber-common/viewport-mercator-project) library. The function can now be called as follows:\n```js\nimport WebMercatorViewport from 'viewport-mercator-project';\nconst viewport = new WebMercatorViewport({width: 600, height: 400});\nconst bound = viewport.fitBounds(\n  [[-73.9876, 40.7661], [-72.9876, 41.7661]],\n  {padding: 20, offset: [0, -40]}\n);\n// => bounds: instance of WebMercatorViewport\n// {longitude: -73.48760000000007, latitude: 41.268014439447484, zoom: 7.209231188444142}\n```\n\n### Deprecations\n\nWe have started to deprecate a few React props. In all the cases below, the old `props` will still work (you'll get a warning in the console), but they will likely be removed in the next major version of react-map-gl so you should start using the new `props` as soon as possible.\n\n| Old Prop                        | New Prop |\n| ---                             | --- |\n| `onChangeViewport(<viewport>)`  | `onViewportChange(<viewport>)` |\n| `onHoverFeatures(<features>)`   | `onHover(<event>)` |\n| `onClickFeatures(<features>)`   | `onClick(<event>)` |\n| `perspectiveEnabled [default: false]` | `dragRotate [default: true]`  |\n\n\n\n## Upgrading to v2\n\nv2 is API compatible with v1, however if you are still using `v1` of react-map-gl, make sure that you first upgrade:\n* Your `node` version to `v4` or higher\n* Your `react` version to `15.4` or higher.\n\nBackground: `mapbox-gl` 0.31.0 introduced a hard dependency on Node >= v4.\n\n\n## Upgrading to v1\n\n(Upgrading from 0.6.x)\n\n* **Importing Overlays** - The map overlay components (`HTMLOverlay`, `CanvasOverlay`, `SVGOverlay` etc) are now named exports. They previously had to be imported via their relative source paths:\n\n```js\n// v1.0\nimport MapGL, {SVGOverlay} from 'react-map-gl';\n\n// v0.6\nimport MapGL from 'react-map-gl';\nimport SVGOverlay from 'react-map-gl/src/api-reference/svg-overlay';.\n```\n\n* **Map State** - The map state reported by `onViewportChanged` will now contain additional state fields (tracking not only `pitch` and `bearing` needed for perspective mode, but also transient information about how the projection is being changed by the user).\n    * This information must be passed back to the react-map-gl component in the next render.\n    * To simplify and future proof applications, it is recommended to simply save the entire `mapState` in your app store whenever it changes and then pass it back to the component rather than trying to keep track of individual fields (like `longitude`, `latitude` and `zoom`).\n","slug":"docs/upgrade-guide","title":"Upgrade Guide"},{"excerpt":"Adding Custom Data Native Mapbox Layers You can inject data and mapbox native layers by modifying the map style object: For details about…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Adding Custom Data\n\n## Native Mapbox Layers\n\nYou can inject data and mapbox native layers by modifying the map style object:\n\n```js\nimport {fromJS} from 'immutable';\nconst mapStyle = fromJS({\n    version: 8,\n    sources: {\n        points: {\n            type: 'geojson',\n            data: {\n                type: 'FeatureCollection',\n                features: [\n                    {type: 'Feature', geometry: {type: 'Point', coordinates: [-122.45, 37.78]}}\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    layers: [\n        {\n            id: 'my-layer',\n            type: 'circle',\n            source: 'points',\n            paint: {\n                'circle-color': '#f00',\n                'circle-radius': 4\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n});\n\n<ReactMapGL mapStyle={mapStyle} ... />\n\n```\n\nFor details about data sources and layer configuration, check out the [Mapbox style specification](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec).\n\nFor dynamically updating data and layers, check out the [GeoJSON](http://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/examples/geojson) and [GeoJSON animation](http://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/examples/geojson-animation) examples.\n\n\n## Overlays\n\nreact-map-gl provides a basic overlay API that enables applications to overlay data on top of maps.\n\nNote that the built-in overlays are intended to provide basic functionality only. For more feature rich and performant data visualization overlay use cases, consider using [deck.gl](https://uber.github.io/deck.gl).\n\n\n### Example\n\n```js\nimport {SVGOverlay} from 'react-map-gl';\n\nfunction redraw({project}) {\n  const [cx, cy] = project([-122, 37]);\n  return <circle cx={cx} cy={cy} r={4} fill=\"blue\" />;\n}\n\n<MapGL {...viewport}>\n  <SVGOverlay redraw={redraw} />\n</MapGL>\n```\n\n\n### Built-in Overlays\n\nBuilt-in overlays are: `SVGOverlay`, `HTMLOverlay`, and `CanvasOverlay`. They are imported using\n```\nimport {SVGOverlay, HTMLOverlay, CanvasOverlay} from 'react-map-gl';\n```\n\n### Example Overlays\n\nThere are a couple of [additional overlays](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl/tree/5.2-release/examples/additional-overlays) in the examples folder that can be copied into applications `ScatterplotOverlay`, `DraggablePointsOverlay`, `ChoroplethOverlay`.\n\n\n### Third-party Overlays\n\nThird party overlays can also be created. For example, the [heatmap-overlay](https://github.com/vicapow/react-map-gl-heatmap-overlay) uses [webgl-heatmap](https://github.com/vicapow/webgl-heatmap) to create geographic heatmaps.\n\n<img width=200 src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/499192/11028150/33f34640-86bc-11e5-9678-3fa1798394d5.gif\" />\n\n```js\nimport HeatmapOverlay from 'react-map-gl-heatmap-overlay';\nimport cities from 'example-cities';\n\n<MapGL {...viewport}>\n  <HeatmapOverlay locations={cities} {...viewport} />\n</MapGL>\n```\n\nWant to create and share your own overlay?

It's recommended to import it from `react-map-gl` instead to avoid future dependency change.\n- **New Example**: [Clusters](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/examples/clusters)\n\n## react-map-gl v5.1\n\nRelease date: Oct 30, 2019\n\n### Highlights\n\n- **New Components**: [`Layer`](/docs/api-reference/layer.md) and [`Source`](/docs/api-reference/source.md) have been added to provide better React parity with the `Mapbox GL JS` API.\n- **Viewport transition**: `transitionDuration` can be set to `'auto'` when using [`FlyToInterpolator`](/docs/api-reference/fly-to-interpolator.md).\n- **New Example**: Add an [example](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/examples/draw-polygon) with drawing library [react-map-gl-draw](https://github.com/uber/nebula.gl/tree/master/modules/react-map-gl-draw).\n\n## react-map-gl v5.0\n\nRelease date: May 31, 2019\n\n### What's Changed\n\nThe only change between the 5.0 release and the latest 4.1 release is Mapbox GL JS v1.0. By using this version, you opt into Mapbox's new pricing model, which bills per map load instead of map views. 5.0.x and 4.1.x will continue to update in parallel with otherwise identical features until November 2019 when Mapbox moves all users of 0.xx to a new pricing scheme. For more details, see mapbox's [changelog](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and [blog post](https://blog.mapbox.com/new-pricing-46b7c26166e7). \n\nAlongside Mapbox GL JS's new milestone, we have relaxed the `mapbox-gl` dependency from locking minor release (`~0.53.0`) to major release (`^1.0.0`). This will allow developers to upgrade faster without waiting for a new release from react-map-gl.\n\n## react-map-gl v4.1\n\nRelease date: Mar 14, 2019 \n\n### Highlights\n\n- **New Components**: [`FullscreenControl`](/docs/api-reference/fullscreen-control.md), [`GeolocateControl`](/docs/api-reference/geolocate-control.md) have been added to provide better React parity with the `Mapbox GL JS` API.\n- **New callback props** `InteractiveMap` supports more callbacks:\n  + `onNativeClick`\n\n## react-map-gl v4.0\n\nRelease date: Nov 5, 2018\n\n### Highlights\n\n- **Relative dimensions** Both `InteractiveMap` and `StaticMap` now support CSS strings supplied to map `width` and `height` props. New `onResize` callback is fired when the map resizes.\n- **React 16** Upgrade to React 16.3 context and ref patterns\n- **Babel 7** Upgrade build system to Babel 7, better support for tree-shaking\n- **Style diffing** Now use Mapbox's native style diffing. Immutable is no longer required.\n- **Draggable Markers** `Marker` component now supports a new prop `draggable`, along with callbacks `onDragStart`, `onDrag`, and `onDragEnd`.\n- **3d Popups** `Popup` component now supports a new prop `sortByDepth` to enable proper occlusion when multiple popups are used in a tilted map.\n- **Interaction states** `onViewportChange` is now called with richer descriptors of the user interaction, including `isPanning`, `isZooming` and `isRotating`.\n- **Interactive layers** Dropped the requirement for the deprecated `interactive` property on the layer styles. Use the `interactiveLayerIds` prop to specify which layers are clickable.\n- **New callback props** `InteractiveMap` supports more callbacks:\n  + `onDblClick`\n  + `onMouseDown`\n  + `onMouseMove`\n  + `onMouseUp`\n  + `onTouchStart`\n  + `onTouchMove`\n  + `onTouchEnd`\n  + `onMouseEnter`\n  + `onMouseLeave`\n  + `onWheel`\n  + `onMouseOut`\n\nSee [upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade-guide.md) for breaking changes.\n\n## react-map-gl v3.3\n\nRelease date: July, 2018\n\n### Highlights\n\n- **New `viewState` Property**: Makes it possible to specify all map state properties (`longitude`, `latitude`, `zoom`, `bearing` and `pitch`) as a single property.\n- **New `onViewStateChange` callback**: An alternative callback that matches the new `viewState` prop.\n\n\n## react-map-gl v3.2\n\nRealease date: January, 2018\n\n### Highlights\n\n- **Viewport transition**: feature equivalent to Mapbox's flyTo and easeTo; smooth transition when using keyboard navigation or the NavigationControl.\n- **Better parity of Mapbox interaction**: navigation using keyboard and the navigation control matches Mapbox behavior, including smooth transition when zooming and panning.\n- **Support for Map Reuse (experimental)**: A new property `reuseMaps` is provided for applications that create and destroy maps, to help work around a mapbox-gl resource leak issue that can lead to a browser crash in certain situations.\n- **mapbox-gl 0.42.2**\n- **New props** of the InteractiveMap component:\n  + Map creation: `transformRequest`, `reuseMaps`\n  + Interaction: `touchZoom`, `touchRotate`\n  + Transition: `transitionDuration`, `transitionInterpolator`, `transitionEasing`, `transitionInterruption`, `onTransitionStart`, `onTransitionInterrupt`, `onTransitionEnd`\n\n\n## react-map-gl v3.1\n\nRelease date: October 19, 2017\n\n### Highlights\n\n- **Event handling**\n  + Support right mouse drag to rotate\n  + Support keyboard navigation\n  + Allow controls and overlays to block map interactions\n- **React 16** - react-map-gl is now being tested with React 16, but the React peer dependency requirement is unchanged at `>=15.4.x`.\n- **mapbox-gl v0.40.1**\n- **No Token warning**: react-map-gl now renders an HTML message if no mapbox token is supplied.\n\n\n## react-map-gl v3.0\n\nRelease date: July 27th, 2017\n\n### Highlights\n\n- **Latest Mapbox GL JS**: Bumps `Mapbox GL JS` to [0.38](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/releases).\n- **Multi-Touch Support**: Full support for multi-touch gestures such as pinch-to-zoom and rotate.\n- **New Components**: The `MapGL` component has been split into [`StaticMap`](/docs/api-reference/static-map.md) and [`InteractiveMap`](/docs/api-reference/interactive-map.md) (the default). Also, [`Popup`](/docs/api-reference/popup.md), [`Marker`](/docs/api-reference/marker.md), [`NavigationControl`](/docs/api-reference/navigation-control.md) have been added to provide better React parity with the `Mapbox GL JS` API.\n- **Improved Overlay Components**: Supplying viewport props (`width` `height` `zoom` `longitude` and `latitude`) are no longer required if you render [`SVGOverlay`](/docs/api-reference/svg-overlay.md), [`CanvasOverlay`](/docs/api-reference/canvas-overlay.md) or [`HTMLOverlay`](/docs/api-reference/html-overlay.md) as a child of the map. Perspective mode is now supported in all overlays.\n- **New Props**: `maxPitch`, `minPitch`, `dragPan`, `doubleClickZoom`, `touchZoomRotate`,\n`scrollZoom` are now provided to allow granular control of map interactivity.\n- **Documentation**: Significantly expanded and linked with our other geospatial frameworks.\n- **Examples**: New stand-alone examples to get you started instantly with the new features.\n- **Event Handling**: New event handling architecture that enables full customization of event handling (experimental).\n\n### Components\n\n#### [InteractiveMap (New, MapGL replacement)](/docs/api-reference/interactive-map.md)\n\nThis is a wrapper on top of `StaticMap`. It takes all the props of `StaticMap` and additional ones such as `onViewportChange`, `scrollZoom`, `dragRotate`, etc. to control interactivity on the map. See [Source Code](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl/tree/3.0-release/src/components/interactive-map.js) for more information.\n\n#### [StaticMap (New)](/docs/api-reference/static-map.md)\n\nThis is the React wrapper around `Mapbox GL JS` and takes in viewport properties such as `width`, `height`, `latitude`, `longitude`. Style diffing and updating logic also live here. See [Source Code](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl/tree/3.0-release/src/components/static-map.js) for more information.\n\n#### Overlays\n\n* Three overlays (`ScatterplotOverlay`, `DraggablePointsOverlay`, `ChoroplethOverlay`), have been moved out of the library and are now only provided as examples.\n\n### Property Changes\n\n- **Property Names** - some prop names have been modernized, the old ones will still work for now with a warning.\n- **Internal Properties** such as `isHovering`, `isDragging`, `startDragLngLat` have been removed.\nThese were never meant to be useful publicly and have caused confusions in the past.\n\n### Utilities\n\n* **fitBounds**: `fitBounds` has been moved to another repository and has been rewritten to provide a more logical interface.\n\nFor more information, see the `Upgrade Guide`.\n\n\n## react-map-gl v2.0\n\nDate: Jan 17, 2017\n\n### Highlights\n- **Latest mapbox-gl**: Bump `mapbox-gl` to v0.31.0\n- **new maxZoom prop** - Add `maxZoom` prop and defaults to `20`\n- **New onLoad prop** - Add `onLoad` event handler\n- **new onClick prop** - Add `onClick` prop handler (#140)\n\n\n## react-map-gl v1.0\n\n* **Perspective Mode** - Now supports `bearing` and `pitch` properties, per mapbox-gl-js api documentation. These props default to 0 which means that maps will still be rendered in flat/ortographic mode when they are not provided\n* **Support for ES6 imports** - The map overlay components (HTMLOverlay, CanvasOverlay, SVGOverlay etc) previously had to be imported via their relative source paths can now be imported directly using `import {SVGOverlay} from 'react-map-gl'.\n\n\n## react-map-gl v0.6\n\nInitial public version\n","slug":"docs/whats-new","title":"What's new"},{"excerpt":"Get Started Installation Using  requires  and .

However, to load the map styles…","rawMarkdownBody":"# About Mapbox Tokens\n\nreact-map-gl and the underlying Mapbox GL JS libraries are open source and free to use. However, to load the map styles and tiles from Mapbox's data service, you will need to register on their website in order to retrieve an access token required by the map component, which will be used to identify you and start serving up map tiles. The service will be free until a certain level of traffic is exceeded.\n\nThere are several ways to provide a token to your app, as showcased in some of the example folders:\n\n* Set the `MapboxAccessToken` environment variable\n* Provide it in the URL, e.g `?access_token=TOKEN`\n* Pass it as a prop to the ReactMapGL instance `<ReactMapGL mapboxApiAccessToken={TOKEN} />`\n\nBut we would recommend using something like [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and put your key in an untracked `.env` file, that will then expose it as a `process.env` variable, with much less leaking risks.\n\n## Display Maps Without A Mapbox Token\n\nIt is possible to use the map component without the Mapbox service, if you use another tile source (for example, if you host your own map tiles). You will need a custom Mapbox GL style that points to your own [vector tile source](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/), and pass it to `ReactMapGL` using the `mapStyle` prop. This custom style must match the schema of your tile source. \n\nOpen source tile schemas include: \n\n- [TileZen schema](https://tilezen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layers/)\n- [OpenMapTiles schema ](https://openmaptiles.org/schema/)\n\nSome useful resources for creating your own map service:\n\n- [Mapbox Vector Tile Spec](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/)\n- [Open source tools](https://github.com/mapbox/awesome-vector-tiles)\n\nIf you are using a third party service that requires header based authentication, you can do this by defining a function to pass to `ReactMapGL` using the `transformRequest` prop.\n\nAn example function:\n\n```js\nconst transformRequest = (url, resourceType) => {\n        if (resourceType === 'Tile' && url.match('yourTileSource.com')) {\n            return {\n                url: url,\n                headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + yourAuthToken }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n","slug":"docs/get-started/mapbox-tokens","title":"About Mapbox Tokens"},{"excerpt":"State Management  is designed to be a stateless component.

Its appearance is entirely controlled by the properties that are passed in from its parent. In this architecture, transition works the same way as interaction: the component shall notify the application of \"user intent\" by calling the `onViewportChange` callback, but ultimately the application needs to decide what to do with it.\n\nThe most simple handling of this intent is to save it and pass it back to the component:\n```jsx\n<ReactMapGL\n    {...this.state.viewport}\n    onViewportChange={(viewport) => this.setState({viewport})} />\n```\n\nUser interaction and transition will not work without a valid `onViewportChange` handler.\n\nThe advantage of this practice is that it ensures a single source of truth regarding the viewport state (in the example above, saved in the `state` of the container component). When you use this viewport state to direct the rendering of other components, it is guaranteed that they will always be synced with the map.\n\nYou may apply additional constraints to the viewport:\n\n```jsx\n_onViewportChange = viewport => {\n    if (viewport.longitude > 0) {\n        viewport.longitude = 0;\n    }\n    this.setState({viewport});\n}\n\nrender() {\n    return <ReactMapGL {...this.state.viewport} onViewportChange={this._onViewportChange} />\n}\n```\n\nOr manipulate the viewport outside of the ReactMap component:\n\n```jsx\n_goToNYC = () => {\n    const viewport = {...this.state.viewport, longitude: -74.1, latitude: 40.7};\n    this.setState({viewport});\n}\n\nrender() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <ReactMapGL {...this.state.viewport} onViewportChange={this._onViewportChange} />\n            <button onClick={this._goToNYC}>New York City</button>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n\n## Using with Redux\n\nIf you're using redux, it is very easy to hook this component up to store state in the redux state tree.\nThe simplest way is to take all properties passed to the `onViewportChange` function property and add them\ndirectly into the store. This state can then be passed back to the `<ReactMapGL>` component without any transformation.\n","slug":"docs/get-started/state-management","title":"State Management"},{"excerpt":"Canvas Overlay Allows applications to overlay data on top of maps using a canvas.

Avoid defining constant objects/arrays inline may help performance.\n\n### Identity Properties\n\nOnce a `<Layer>` is mounted, the following props should not change. If you add/remove multiple JSX layers dynamically, make sure you use React's [key prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) to give each element a stable identity.\n\n##### `id` (String)\n\nUnique identifier of the layer. If not provided, a default id will be assigned.\n\n##### `type` (String, required)\n\nType of the layer.\n\n### Options\n\n##### `beforeId` (String)\n\nThe ID of an existing layer to insert this layer before. If this prop is omitted, the layer will be appended to the end of the layers array. This is useful when using dynamic layers with a map style from a URL.\n\nNote that layers are added by the order that they mount.

Default `none`. See [hammer.js doc](http://hammerjs.github.io/touch-action/).\n\nBy default, the map captures all touch interactions. This prop is useful for mobile applications to unblock default scrolling behavior. For example, use the combination `dragPan: false` and `touchAction: 'pan-y'` to allow vertical page scroll when dragging over the map.\n\n\n##### `clickRadius` (Number)\n\n- default: `0`\n\nRadius to detect features around a clicked point.\n\n##### `controller` (Object)\n\nA map controller instance to replace the default map controller.\n\nThis object must implement the following interface:\n- `events` - An array of subscribed events\n- `handleEvent(event, context)` - A method that handles interactive events\n\n##### `interactiveLayerIds` (Array)\n\n- default: `null`\n\nA list of layer ids that are interactive. If specified:\n- Pointer event callbacks will only query the features under the pointer of these layers.\n- The `getCursor` callback will receive `isHovering: true` when hover over features of these layers.\n\nIf not specified:\n- Pointer event callbacks will query the features under the pointer of all layers.\n- The `getCursor` callback will always receive `isHovering: false`.\n\n\n### Transitions\n\n##### `transitionDuration` (Number)\n\n- default: `0`\n\nDuration of transition in milliseconds. If specified, the map's viewport will smoothly move from the previous props to the current one.\n\n##### `transitionInterpolator` (Object)\n\n- default: `new LinearInterpolator()`\n\nAn interpolator object that defines the transition behavior between two map states. `react-map-gl` offers two interpolators:\n- `LinearInterpolator` - similar to Mapbox's `easeTo` behavior.\n- `FlyToInterpolator` - similar to Mapbox's `flyTo` behavior.\n\nYou may import them as follows:\n```jsx\nimport ReactMapGL, {LinearInterpolator, FlyToInterpolator} from 'react-map-gl';\n\n<ReactMapGL transitionDuration={1000} transitionInterpolator={new FlyToInterpolator()}>\n```\n\nFor details about using transition interpolators, see [transitions](/docs/advanced/viewport-transitions.md).\n\n##### `transitionEasing` (Function)\n\n- default: `t => t`\n\nEasing function that maps a value from `[0, 1]` to `[0, 1]`. Check out [http://easings.net/](http://easings.net/) for common easing curves.\n\n##### `transitionInterruption` (Number)\n\n- default: `TRANSITION_EVENTS.BREAK`\n\nWhat to do if an ongoing transition is interrupted by another transition.

If not supplied, the map is not interactive.\n\n```js\nonViewportChange(viewState, interactionState, oldViewState);\n```\n\nArguments:\n\n- `viewState` (Object) The next viewport properties, including: `width`, `height`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `zoom`, `bearing`, `pitch`, `altitude`, `maxZoom`, `minZoom`, `maxPitch`, `minPitch`, `transitionDuration`, `transitionEasing`, `transitionInterpolator`, `transitionInterruption`.\n- `interactionState` (Object) The current interaction that caused this viewport change. See `onInteractionStateChange` for possible fields.\n- `oldViewState` (Object) The current viewport properties.\n\n\n##### `onViewStateChange` (Function)\n\nA newer version of the `onViewportChange` callback.

This is designed to be completely\nstatic, and should be used to render a map with no interactivity. For a component\nthat supports full user interactivity, see [InteractiveMap](/docs/api-reference/interactive-map.md).\n\n```js\nimport {Component} from 'react';\nimport {StaticMap} from 'react-map-gl';\n\nclass Map extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <StaticMap\n        width={400}\n        height={400}\n        latitude={37.7577}\n        longitude={-122.4376}\n        zoom={8} />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Properties\n\n### Initialization\n\nThe following props are used during the creation of the Mapbox map.\n\n##### `attributionControl` (Boolean)\n\n- default: `true`\n\nEquivalent to Mapbox's `attributionControl` [option](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map). If `true`, shows Mapbox's attribution control.\n\n##### `disableTokenWarning` (Boolean)\n\n- default: `false`\n\nIf the provided API access token is rejected by Mapbox, `StaticMap` renders a warning instead of failing silently. If you know what you are doing and want to hide this warning anyways, set this prop to `true`.\n\n##### `gl` (WebGLContext)\n\n> This prop is experimental.\n\nUse an existing WebGLContext instead of creating a new one. This allows multiple libraries to render into a shared buffer. Use with caution.\n\n##### `mapboxApiAccessToken` (String)\n\nMapbox API access token for `MapboxGL`. Required when using Mapbox vector tiles/styles\nMapbox WebGL context creation option. Useful when you want to export the canvas as a PNG\n\n##### `mapboxApiUrl` (String)\n\n- default: `https://api.mapbox.com`\n\nEnables the use of private and country specific servers Mapbox servers, e.g. https://api.mapbox.cn/.\n\n##### `mapOptions` (Object)\n\n- default: `{}`\n\n> Non-public API, see https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl/issues/545\n\nAn object of additional options to be passed to Mapbox's [`Map` constructor](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map). Options specified here\nwill take precedence over those same options if set via props.\n\n##### `preserveDrawingBuffer` (Boolean)\n\n- default: `false`\n\nEquivalent to Mapbox's `preserveDrawingBuffer` [option](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map). If `true`, the map's canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`.\n\n##### `preventStyleDiffing` (Boolean)\n\n- default: `false`\n\nIf `mapStyle` is assigned an Immutable object, when the prop changes, `StaticMap` can diff between the two values and call the appropriate Mapbox API such as `addLayer`, `removeLayer`, `setStyle`, `setData`, etc.\nThis allows apps to update data sources and layer styles efficiently. In use cases such as animation or dynamic showing/hiding layers, style diffing prevents the map from reloading and flickering when the map style changes.\n\nThere are known issues with style diffing. As stopgap, use this option to prevent style diffing.\n\n##### `reuseMaps` (Boolean)\n\n- default: `false`\n\n> This prop is experimental.\n\nIf `true`, when the map component is unmounted, instead of calling `remove` on the Mapbox map instance, save it for later reuse. This will avoid repeatedly creating new Mapbox map instances if possible.\n\nApplications that frequently mount and unmount maps may try this prop to help work around a mapbox-gl resource leak issue that can lead to a browser crash in certain situations.\n\n##### `transformRequest` (Function)\n\n- default: `null`\n\nA callback run before the Map makes a request for an external URL. The callback can be used to modify the url, set headers, or set the credentials property for cross-origin requests.\nExpected to return an object with a `url` property and optionally `headers` and `credentials` properties.  Equivalent to Mapbox's `transformRequest` [map option](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api#map).\n\n\n### Map State\n\n##### `mapStyle` (String | Object | Immutable.Map)\n\n- default: `'mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v8'`\n\nThe Mapbox style. A string url or a\n[MapboxGL style](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/#layer-interactive)\nobject (regular JS object or Immutable.Map).\n\nWhenever the `mapStyle` prop changes, the component will attempt to update the style of the underlying Mapbox map. The behavior can be further customized with the `preventStyleDiffing` prop.\n\n`mapStyle` is ignored when explicitly set to `null`.\n\n##### `width` (Number | String, required)\n\nThe width of the map. Can be either a number in pixels, or a valid CSS string.\n\n##### `height` (Number | String, required)\n\nThe height of the map. Can be either a number in pixels, or a valid CSS string.\n\n##### `latitude` (Number)\n\nThe latitude of the center of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if `viewState` is not supplied.\n\n##### `longitude` (Number)\n\nThe longitude of the center of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if `viewState` is not supplied.\n\n##### `zoom` (Number)\n\nThe tile zoom level of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if `viewState` is not supplied.\n\nBounded implicitly by default `minZoom` and `maxZoom` of `MapboxGL`\n\n##### `bearing` (Number)\n\n- default: `0`\n\nSpecify the bearing of the viewport, as a top level prop. Only used if `viewState` is not supplied.\n\n##### `pitch` (Number)\n\n- default: `0`\n\nSpecify the pitch of the viewport, as a top level prop. Only used if `viewState` is not supplied..\n\n##### `altitude` (Number)\n\n- default: `1.5`\n\n> Non-public API, see https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/1137.\n\nAltitude of the viewport camera, relative to screen height.\n\n##### `viewState` (Object)\n\nAn object containing the view state of the map specified by the following fields:\n* `latitude` (Number) - The latitude of the center of the map.\n* `longitude` (Number) - The longitude of the center of the map.\n* `zoom` (Number) - The tile zoom level of the map. Bounded implicitly by default `minZoom` and `maxZoom` of `MapboxGL`.\n* `bearing` (Number) - default: `0` - The bearing of the viewport.\n* `pitch` (Number) - default: `0` - The pitch of the viewport.\n* `altitude` (Number) - default: `1.5 screen heights`\n\nNote: Either the `viewState`, or the `latitude`, `longitude` and `zoom` properties need to be specified.\n\n\n### Render Options\n\n##### `asyncRender` (Boolean)\n\n- default: `false`\n\nIf `true`, let Mapbox manage its own render cycle. This is the behavior prior to v4.1.\n\nIf `false`, force Mapbox canvas to redraw with DOM updates. This will make the map synchronize better with other controls during prop-driven viewport changes.\n\n##### `style` (Object)\n\nThe CSS style of the map container.\n\n##### `visible` (Boolean)\n\n- default: `true`\n\nWhether the map is visible. Unmounting and re-mounting a Mapbox instance is known to be costly. This option offers a way to hide a map using CSS style.\n\n##### `visibilityConstraints` (Object)\n\nAn object that specifies bounds for viewport props with `min*`, `max*` keys. If the viewport props are outside of these constraints, the Mapbox map is automatically hidden.\n\nDefault: `{ minZoom: 0, maxZoom: 20, minPitch: 0, maxPitch: 60 }`\n\n\n### Callbacks\n\n##### `onLoad` (Function)\n\n- default: `() => {}`\n\nA callback run when the map emits a `load` event. [Mapbox docs](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api#map.event:load)\n\n##### `onResize` (Function)\n\n- default: `() => {}`\n\nA callback run when the map size has changed.\n\n##### `onError` (Function)\n\n- default: `console.error`\n\nA callback run when the map emits an `error` event. [Mapbox docs](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api#map.event:error)\n\n\n## Methods\n\n##### `getMap`\n\nReturns the Mapbox instance if initialized. The `Map` instance will have full access to [MapboxGL's API](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map).\n\n`getMap()`\n\n##### `queryRenderedFeatures`\n\nUse Mapbox's `queryRenderedFeatures` API to find features at point or in a bounding box.

For transitions to work, the application must update the viewport props returned by the `onViewportChange` callback:\n\n```js\n<ReactMapGL\n    {...this.state.viewport}\n    onViewportChange={(viewport) => this.setState({viewport})}\n```\n\nRemarks:\n- The props returned by the callback may contain transition properties. For example, during panning and rotating, the callback is invoked with `transitionDuration: 0`, meaning that the map movement instantly matches the change of the pointer. When panning or zooming with keyboard, the callback is invoked with a 300ms linear transition.\n- It is recommended that when programatically triggering a transition, always explicitly set the transition properties (interpolator, easing and duration).\n- \"Set and forget\": the values of the following props at the start of a transition carry through the entire duration of the transition:\n  + `transitionDuration`\n  + `transitionInterpolator`\n  + `transitionEasing`\n  + `transitionInterruption`\n- The default interaction/transition behavior can always be intercepted and overwritten in the handler for `onViewportChange`. However, if a transition is in progress, the properties that are being transitioned (e.g. longitude and latitude) should not be manipulated, otherwise the change will be interpreted as an interruption of the transition.\n- When using `FlyToInterpolator` for `transitionInterpolator`, `transitionDuration` can be set to `'auto'` where actual duration is auto calculated based on start and end viewports and is linear to the distance between them. This duration can be further customized using `speed` parameter to `FlyToInterpolator` constructor.\n\n\n### Transition Interpolators\n\nA `TransitionInterpolator` instance must be supplied to the `transitionInterpolator` prop. It contains the following methods:\n\n- `arePropsEqual(currentProps, nextProps)` - called to determine if transition should be triggered when viewport props update.\n- `initiateProps(startProps, endProps)` - called before transition starts to pre-process the start and end viewport props.\n- `interpolateProps(startProps, endProps, t)` - called to get viewport props in transition. `t` is a time factor between `[0, 1]`.\n\nreact-map-gl offers two built-in interpolator classes:\n\n- [LinearInterpolator](/docs/api-reference/linear-interpolator.md)\n- [FlyToInterpolator](/docs/api-reference/fly-to-interpolator.md)\n","slug":"docs/advanced/viewport-transition","title":"Viewport Transition"}]}}}
