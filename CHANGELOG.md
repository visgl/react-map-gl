# Version 7.0

## 7.0.0 (Feb 4, 2022)

v7 is a complete rewrite of the library. It addresses many long-standing issues in v5 and v6 limited by legacy architecture decisions. The most notable results of this redesign are:

- Performance: minimize the overhead of React, offer the same fast and smooth interaction as the native library
- Lightweight: the ESM build size is reduced from 219k to 57k
- Predictability: Components behave the same as their mapbox counterparts. Props are mapped 1:1 from the native options wherever appropriate. Almost all imperative APIs (`flyTo`, `fitBounds` etc.) can now be called directly without breaking the React binding.
- Compatibility: first and third-party plugins! Directly use [mapbox-gl-draw](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl/tree/7.0-release/examples/draw-polygon), [mapbox-gl-geocoder](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl/tree/7.0-release/examples/geocoder), to name a few.
- TypeScript compliant: the code base is now entirely written in TypeScript, and all types can be [imported](/docs/api-reference/types.md).
